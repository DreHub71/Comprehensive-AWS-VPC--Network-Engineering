# Comprehensive-AWS-VPC--Network-Engineering
Architected a secure, scalable AWS network using Amazon VPC, with public and private subnets to isolate application tiers and database resources. Implemented multi-layer security by configuring stateful Security Groups and stateless Network ACLs to control traffic at both the instance and subnet level.
